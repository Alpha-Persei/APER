# APER Token

Alpha Persei (Latinized from α Persei, abbreviated Alpha Per, α Per), is the Token of the Alpha Persei DAO. It is a simple ERC20 Token (using the OpenZeppelin Template), with an import of the Ownable library. We keep the option alive to move the ownership of the contract to another wallet at some point in time, when we are in possession of more secure mechanisms. 

1. Deploying the contract will mint 8.111.817.543 APER, equivalent to approximate amount of humans on earth.
2. We are working with a fixed supply no additional tokens can be minted.
3. We did not include the option of burning tokens in the contract sufficient other methods exist.
